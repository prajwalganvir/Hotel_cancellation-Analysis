The line graph above shows that on certain days the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel and on other days it is even less it goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rate

We have developed the grouped paragraph to analyze the months with the highest and the lowest reservation level according to reservation status as can be seen both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are large in the month of August whereas January is the month with the most cancelation reservation

Let's check the area from where guests are visiting the hotel and making reservation is it coming from direct or group online or offline travel agents?

around 46% of the client come from online travel agents whereas 27% comes from groups only 4% of the client's book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations

As seen in the graph reservation are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not canceled it clearly proves all the above analysis that the highest price leads to higher cancelation

## **Suggestions:-**

- Cancelation rate rise as the price turns in order to prevent cancelation of reservation hotel could work on their price strategy and try to lower the rate for specific hotel based on location they can also provide some discount to the customers.
- As the ratio of the cancelation and not cancelation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels so the hotel should provide a reasonable discount on the room price on weekends or on holidays.
- In the month of January hotel can start campaigning or marketing with the reasonable amount to increase the revenue as the cancelation is the highest in this month.
- They can also increase the quality of their hotel and their services mainly in the Portugal to reduce the cancelation rate.
